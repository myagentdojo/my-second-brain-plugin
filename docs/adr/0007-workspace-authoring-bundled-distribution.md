# Author in a Bun workspace, ship bundled dependency-free skills

## Status

Accepted — 2026-08-06. Complements ADR 0006 (single Bun runtime) and ADR 0005
(shared runtime custody). Where those decide how the *runtime* reaches the
consumer, this decides how *dependencies* do.

Declared compiled skills follow the accepted scoped amendment in
[Compiled plugin development](0010-compiled-plugin-development.md).
The remaining contract below is preserved.

## Context

ADR 0006 makes every plugin a bootstrapped-Bun program, and ADR 0005 shares one
runtime across many skills. That solves runtime custody but leaves a separate
cost: each skill has its own dependencies. With ~20 skills, each carrying a
`package.json`, the questions are: how are dependency versions kept consistent,
and what does the consumer have to install?

Bootstrapping the runtime is cheap and one-time (ADR 0006). Installing
dependencies per consumer is not: it reintroduces network fetches, lockfile
reconciliation across many packages, offline failure, and the Python-style
"present but fighting the package manager" friction — the exact costs the
runtime bootstrap was designed to avoid.

The repository demonstrates the answer with two isolated workspace members and
one frozen root lock. Each member declares exact dependency versions and the
build admits the resolved pure-JavaScript closure before emitting bundled
artifacts. The runtime skill catalog is a separate owner: it maps logical skill
ids to launchers, bundles, and runtime identity; it is not a dependency-version
catalog.

## Decision

Separate authoring from distribution.

- **Authoring: one Bun workspace.** All skills are workspace members. A
  frozen root lock resolves exact member dependencies through Bun's isolated
  linker with lifecycle scripts ignored. Dependency admission rejects phantom
  dependencies, native artifacts, unresolved peers, and unreviewed lifecycle
  behavior. Adding a dependency-bearing skill is adding a workspace member and
  a logical runtime-catalog entry.
- **Distribution: per-skill bundles, dependency-free.** Each skill is bundled
  (`bun build`) into a self-contained artifact with its dependencies inlined.
  The shipped plugin contains bundled entrypoints, never `node_modules`, never
  per-skill `package.json` dependencies, and never a consumer-side install
  step. This is the pattern browser-use already ships.

The consumer therefore pays the runtime bootstrap once (ADR 0006) and installs
**zero dependencies, ever**. Dependencies are resolved at author build time, in
the author's workspace, and baked into the artifact.

### Per-skill vs whole-plugin bundling

Chosen: **per-skill bundles** — one self-contained artifact per skill, matching
browser-use. Skills stay independently buildable and shippable; the launcher
(ADR 0005 custody engine) selects a skill's bundled entrypoint.

Rejected: **one whole-plugin bundle** with shared dependencies deduplicated.
It avoids duplicating a shared library across bundles, but couples all skills
into one build and weakens independent shipping. The saving is bundle *size*,
not install *cost* (install cost is already zero), and any duplication is
trivial next to the ~60 MB bootstrapped runtime. Not worth the coupling.

## Consequences

- The "20 skills each with a package.json" problem does not exist at
  distribution time: none of those `package.json` files or their `node_modules`
  ship. They are authoring-time inputs only.
- Consumer install cost is the runtime bootstrap alone. No dependency fetch, no
  lockfile reconciliation, no offline-install failure.
- Exact dependency versions and their resolved bytes are governed by member
  manifests plus the one frozen root lock. The build admits the complete
  resolved closure and generates third-party notices.
- A shared library used by several skills is duplicated across their bundles.
  This costs bundle size, not install time, and is negligible against the
  runtime. Revisit only if total artifact size becomes a real constraint.
- Bundling is the release-time boundary: the payload walker, checksums, and
  distribution proof (from the publishing-hardening work) apply to the bundled
  artifacts, not to source or `node_modules`.

## Implemented follow-up

- The fixed builder emits one digest-named ESM artifact per workspace skill,
  validates the inventory and notices, and rejects stale or orphaned outputs.
- The generated runtime inventory maps each logical catalog skill to its exact
  bundle digest; custody executes that bundle, never a source tree or
  `node_modules`.
- A workspace skill's `entry` remains required catalog and projection metadata;
  execution selects the digest-named artifact from the generated bundle
  inventory rather than executing that source-style entry path directly.
