# Agent Plugin Template

Build one Git-distributed plugin payload for Claude Code and Codex. Keep shared behavior portable; keep each harness's manifest, trust, and lifecycle adapter native.

## Owners

- Plugin metadata: edit `plugin.config.json`; run `bun run generate`.
- Release identity or version: route through `scripts/init.ts` or the generated release PR. `.github/release-please-config.json` owns the Release Please package name.
- Skill workflow: edit `plugin/skills/<id>/`.
- Portable implementation: edit dependency-free commands in `runtime/src/`; edit dependency-bearing workspace code in `packages/<id>/src/`; register bundles in `runtime/skill-catalog.json`.
- Runtime custody: edit the engine in `plugin/runtime/runtime-exec` or the approved runtime identity in `runtime/runtime.lock.json`; preserve `docs/adr/0005-shared-runtime-custody.md` and `docs/adr/0006-single-bun-runtime-tier.md`.
- Generated output: follow the source header when present. For headerless manifests and hook JSON, edit `plugin.config.json` and run `bun run generate`. For bundles, inventory, and notices, edit workspace sources and run `bun run build`. Commit source and output together.
- Packaging: `scripts/package.ts` observes the source commit and prepares the payload; the Agent Plugin Kit pinned in `package.json#dependencies.agent-plugin-kit` produces the archive and checksums through `scripts/package-adapter.ts`. Change the pin only to a reviewed Kit commit.
- Release or publishing behavior: read `docs/adr/0003-reviewed-versioned-releases.md` and route through `docs/releasing.md`.
- Runtime or dependency distribution architecture: read `docs/adr/0006-single-bun-runtime-tier.md` and `docs/adr/0007-workspace-authoring-bundled-distribution.md` before editing.
- Harness adapters or lifecycle hooks: read `docs/adr/0001-one-payload-native-harness-adapters.md` and `docs/adr/0008-native-plugin-capability-tour.md` before editing.
- Historical plans: use `docs/plans/` for rationale only; reconcile every proposal with current code and accepted ADRs.

## Change Loop

1. Find the canonical source and its generated or packaged consumers.
2. Change the smallest owning surface; preserve Claude and Codex asymmetries.
3. For behavior changes, add focused contract coverage beside the owning script or runtime module.
4. Run the focused test, `bun run generate:check`, then the smallest relevant proof from `package.json`.
5. With both `claude` and `codex` on `PATH`, run `bun run prove:all` for payload, packaging, runtime-custody, or cross-harness changes; otherwise report the unavailable native prerequisite. Local completion means the worktree contains only the intended diff and every applicable local check passes.

## Proof Boundaries

- Keep harness tests isolated from real user profiles, plugin settings, credentials, caches, and persistent data.
- Outside isolated acknowledged fixtures, present the repair preview and obtain human approval before `repair --apply`; a changed Bun executable identity requires fresh approval.
- Treat direct handler execution and package-byte checks as mechanics proof, not native discovery, trust, activation, UI, or delegation proof.
- Fresh native completion: follow `docs/native-capability-qualification.md`; every bounded cell needs a human-recorded result bound to one candidate.
- Hosted or PR completion: follow `docs/pull-requests-and-ci.md`; every required check must pass on the current head. Revalidate canaries, safeguards, and release state before release claims.
- Raw native receipts: follow the private XDG location, permissions, and promotion boundary in `docs/native-capability-qualification.md`.
- Never let a failed check read as a satisfied one. In verification code, distinguish "proved absent" from "could not prove", and fail closed on the second. This is the recurring defect in the release and readiness paths: `|| true` turning an API outage into an empty result, a `gh` exit code standing in for a 404, an unrelated object answering for the one that was asked about, a discarded malformed page reporting a value as missing. Each reported healthy while the thing it guarded was broken. Prefer an explicit status check over an exit code, and give the unprovable case its own outcome rather than folding it into the negative one.
- Preserve the consumer contract: no user-managed Bun, Node.js, Python, npm, or setup command.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as GitHub issues in `myagentdojo/agent-plugin-template`, managed with `gh` or process-scoped `ghh` for concurrent agents. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles use their default label strings. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Multi-context: `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root points at each context's `CONTEXT.md`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
